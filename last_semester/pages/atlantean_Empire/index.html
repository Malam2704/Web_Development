                <dd><p>It doesn't matter who you've tormented or what you've done in the past, we put that all behind us! A new era has unfolded and it is called ATLANTIS!</p>
                    <p>Open up a new chapter and let us be the family that people in our past have denied us, let us be the ones who leave their mark on history instead of those less deserving of it and let this Empire and its members be the unyielding entities that strike fear and envy in the hearts of mortals.</p>
                    <p>As divine and peerless as we may be, there will come a time where we too will face hardships and no matter how great or small it may seem to be, we will always guide and support those in need. Regardless of what anyone says or does...</p>
                    <p>Bask in the solace of knowing that we have been unshackled from all our bindings and that The Atlantean Empire shall remain ruling over the frail mortals for all eternity.</p>
