            <div class="item2" id="intro">
                <h3>Why the anticipation?</h3>
                <p>CyberPunk 2077, you’ve 100% heard it before. If you 
                    are a gamer, there's no doubt about it you’ve heard 
                    it before.</p>
                <p>Plus there have been a controversy speculating around this
                    game such as the many, many, many delays associeated with it.
                    Talks of this project ahev been afloat sicne 2017-2018, and with
                    the release dat coming <span>December 10th, 2020</span> you shouldn't 
                    be surprised at what the result will create.
                </p>
                <p>We know the graphics for this game won't be good, it will be PHENOMINAL!
                    This has been due to the PS5 and the aesthetic & rendering powers of the new age consoles,
                    not to mention the studio that developed The Witcher 3 creating this project aswell.
                </p>
            </div>

            <div class="item3">
                <h3>Why so special?</h3>
                <p>
                    In this Dystopian Futurescape, you play as V, a mercenary in the dystopian 
                    future, in the year 2077. The cyberpunk aesthetics has been given to 
                    the whole game, where the neon and urban development clash into a 
                    space aged theme. Shown by Image above.  
                </p>
                <p>A smaller, but not insignificant part of the game includes the renowned
                    actor Keanu Reeves, frm classics such as the Bill & Ted Series and the Matrix 
                    Story. The community & "gamers" associated with the game, have had a storng 
                    attraction to Mr. Reeves, as oen could see with a simple scroll through of reddit.
                </p>
                <p>To add on to those further delays, there have been widespread rumors about this
                    game going on sicne 2013, yeah 7 years, and that not it. The game has kept players waiting
                    since it's debut in the 80's as a tabletop RPG.
                </p>
            </div>

            <div class="item4">
                <h3>The Mechanics</h3>
                <p>We are in Night City California, (an imaginary city like that of San 
                    Francisco nearby), where there are 6 regions. The corporate City 
                    Center, Immigrant possessed Watson, rich Westbrook, rural Heywood,
                    pack pervaded Pacifica and mechanical Santo Domingo. Its encompassing 
                    territory, the Badlands, can likewise be investigated. V explores 
                    these areas by walking and in vehicles, which are dependent upon 
                    either a first or third-individual view. Walkers are helpless 
                    against vehicular impacts. 
                </p>
                <p>
                    You play as V the mercenary and like many other games you can modify 
                    & control the features of your character in play, such as hair styles 
                    outfits & colors. You can also earn points to unlock Bio-Hacks, which 
                    gives others upgrades. You play with specific classes such as the Body,
                    Intelligence, Reflexes, Technical, and Cool—are affected by the 
                    character classes that players accept, which are NetRunner (hacking), 
                    Techie (hardware), and Solo (battle). V must counsel a "ripperdoc" 
                    to update and buy cyberware inserts; underground markets offer 
                    military-grade abilities. The uncommonness of some random gear is 
                    appeared by a shaded level framework.
