            <h2>Write-Ups</h2>
            <p> I've made various Blog Posts advertising our products. I thought of
                my writing stlye as friendly, and trying to be the customer's friend.
                I also took informative approaches when it came to the product page, displaying all
                the details of the product accurately.

                alt="House of Sand & Fog Alt. Cover"
                >
            </figure>
            <p>As you can see form the cover above, I recreated
                the cover of the book the House of Sand and Fog by the 
                author Andre Dubus III, and my professor was so impressed
                she notfied him, and I got to share my design with the author himself.
