			Wyoming is a state in the mountain region of the western United States. 
			The state is the 10th largest by area, the least populous and the second 
			least densely populated state in the country. Wyoming is bordered on the 
			north by Montana, on the east by South Dakota and Nebraska, on the south 
			by Colorado, on the southwest by Utah, and on the west by Idaho and 
			Montana. The state population was estimated at 586,107 in 2015, which is 
			less than 31 of the most populous U.S. cities including neighboring 
			Denver. <span id="state_capital">Cheyenne is the state capital</span> and the most populous city, 
			with population estimated at 63,335 in 2015.

			<p>
			The western two-thirds of the state is covered mostly by the mountain 
			ranges and rangelands of the Rocky Mountains, while the eastern third 
			of the state is high elevation prairie called the High Plains. Almost 
			half of the land in Wyoming is owned by the U.S. government, leading 
			Wyoming to rank sixth by area and fifth by proportion of a state's land 
			owned by the federal government. Federal lands include two national 
			parks-Grand Teton and Yellowstone-two national recreation areas, two 
			national monuments and several national forests.

			<h2>Original Inhabitants</h2>

			<p>
			Original inhabitants of the region include the Crow, Arapaho, Lakota, 
			and Shoshone. Southwestern Wyoming was in the Spanish Empire and then 
			Mexican territory until it was ceded to the United States in 1848 at 
			the end of the Mexican-American War. The region acquired the name 
			Wyoming when a bill was introduced to the U.S. Congress in 1865 to 
			provide a "temporary government for the territory of Wyoming". The name 
			was used earlier for the Wyoming Valley in Pennsylvania, and is derived 
			from the Munsee word xwe:wamenk, meaning "at the big river flat".
			</p>

			<h2>Economy</h2>
			<p>
			The main drivers of Wyoming's economy are mineral extraction?mostly 
			coal, oil, natural gas, and trona?and tourism. Agricultural commodities 
			include livestock (beef), hay, sugar beets, grain (wheat and barley), 
			and wool. The climate is semi-arid and continental, drier and windier than 
			the rest of the U.S., with greater temperature extremes.
