		<h1>Letchworth State Park</h1>

		Letchworth State Park, renowned as the "Grand Canyon of the East," 
		is one of the most scenically magnificent areas in the eastern U.S. 
		The Genesee River roars through the gorge over three major waterfalls 
		between cliffs--as high as 600 feet in some places--surrounded by l
		ush forests. Hikers can choose among 66 miles of hiking trails. Trails 
		are also available for horseback riding, biking, snowmobiling and 
		cross-country skiing. Letchworth offers nature, history and performing 
		arts programs, guided walks, tours, a summer lecture series, whitewater 
		rafting, kayaking, a pool for swimming and hot air ballooning.

		In 1859, <span id="industrialist">industrialist William Pryor Letchworth (1823-1910) began 
		purchasing land near the Middle Falls, and started construction of 
		his Glen Iris Estate.</span> In 1906 he bequeathed the 1,000-acre (4 km2) 
		estate to New York, which soon after became the core of the newly 
		created Letchworth State Park.[1][2]
		</p>

		<p>
		The park prominently features three large waterfalls — the Upper, 
		Middle, and Lower Falls — on the Genesee River, which flows within 
		a deep gorge that winds through the park. The rock walls of the gorge, 
		which rise up to 550 feet (170 m) in places, prompted the area's 
		reputation as the "Grand Canyon of the East".[3]

		Within the park, there are three large waterfalls on the Genesee River 
		and as many as 50 waterfalls found on tributaries that flow into it; 
		the deep gorge formed by the river, with rock walls rising up to 
		550 feet (170 m) in places and which narrow to 400 feet (120 m) across 
		above the middle of the three falls, prompted the area's reputation as 
		the "Grand Canyon of the East".[1] The three major waterfalls — called 
		the Upper, Middle, and Lower Falls — are located in Portage Canyon, the 
		southern section of the park. The only trail bridging the Genesee River 
		in the park crosses a stone bridge just below the Lower Falls. The 
		Middle Falls is the highest, and the Upper Falls has an active railroad 
		trestle crossing immediately above it.

		<h3>
		Historic sites and museums
		</h3>

		<p>
		The historic, restored Glen Iris Inn, William Pryor Letchworth's 
		former residence adapted for use as a hotel, is located on the 
		top of a cliff overlooking Middle Falls and offers in-season meals 
		and overnight accommodations.[1] It is open to the public for 
		breakfast, lunch and dinner.
		</p>

		<p>
		The park is the present-day site of the grave of Mary Jemison, a 
		Scots-Irish immigrant pioneer who was captured at the age of 12 from 
		central Pennsylvania by a French and Shawnee raiding party during the 
		French and Indian War. She was soon adopted by a family of Seneca 
		people, and eventually lived in western New York on the Genesee River. 
		She had become thoroughly assimilated and chose to live with the 
		Seneca for the rest of her long life, having a total of seven children 
		by two successive husbands. Her remains were exhumed from the Buffalo 
		Creek Reservation and reinterred on the grounds of a Seneca Council 
		House, relocated to the site by Letchworth and rededicated in 1872.[4]
