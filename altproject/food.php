        <p>Since this is New York city, and all of the world collides here, we get some pretty awesome food. No place can beat the city, if you lived your entire life
            going to the tens of thousands of resturants in the city, you would not make it, new ones come and go, many temporary locations too. But my tip in all is,
            AVOID CAPITALISM! Commercialization is a realy problem where we have places such as Ray's Pizza, Katz's Deli, and The Halal guys, who used to be some of our key
            favorites go down in the whole trying to market themselves, and essentially end up like any other fast food joint. Don't trust these people.
        </p>
        <p>For me, it's all about the authentic cuisine, you can go into any neighborhood and I guarantee you can get good foodm at any price. I'm avoiding michellin resturants
            because, most people don't have that type of money, also the tourists and fake transplants.

        <h3>Here are some of my local favorites</h3>

            <p>Sagar Chinese: An Asian Fusion of South Asian, South East Asian, and East Asian foods. You can get anything from ranging form Chicken Briyani to your Chicken Lo Mein.
                This place is pretty affordable, Lunch special costs $7.95 comes with rice, chicken, soup and a soda. Now in NYC that's a steal you can't give up. Their infamous 
                items are the Chicken Lollopops, that come with their secret sauce, there's a reason why there so busy. This taste of Chicken, Carrots, Siracha, Mayo , Pepper, And
                many Oriental & Indian spices come together to make a flavorful explosion.

            <p>New Fu Fan Resturant: 100% the best take out place, I've been going here for over a decade. Local prices you can get meals for as low as $5. The Orange Chicken is to die for,
                and all of these resturnats I'm entioning are local & family owned so you know it's good to support them. The chicken fried rice with fried chicken wings is a good steal for $5.50,
                fill it with duck sauce and hot sauce, and you can see why everyone from all Ethnicities come to this spot.
            </p>

        <div>
            <p>Local Halal Carts: These carts are on every corner, but be wary of the ones in touristy areas such as the MET, they will rip you off. Get the Chicken over rice was $5 for almost 15 years, but now $6 for inflation, be sure to get in before it's crowded though
                becuase everyone comes here, and it grows fast. If you're a regular  guy they will Bless you with more meat, Chicken or Lamb, or rice. People will tell you to get the white sauce,
                but it's way too many calories, I just get the Hot sauce and/or BBQ sauce.
            </p>

        <div>
            <p>Famous Pizza: An old pizzeria franchise that servers traditional New York Pizza, it's somewhat franchised and taste has gotten a bit lesser over time, can't beat their good old days.
                But it's still a good joint and way ahead of Dominos and Papa Johns, which have vairous locations within walking distance. Fmaous has a handful of locations, and have the best Brooklyn 
                Style Pizza, and for cheap too, A 2 person pie is about $6, and filled with soft mozarella, traditional sauce, and a crunchy thin crust.
