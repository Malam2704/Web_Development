                    Over many a quaint and curious volume of forgotten lore,
            
                    While I nodded, nearly napping, suddenly there came a tapping,
            
                    As of some one gently rapping, rapping at my chamber door.
            
                    "'Tis some visiter," I muttered, "tapping at my chamber door --
            
                                            Only this, and nothing more."</p>

                    And each separate dying ember wrought its ghost upon the floor.
            
                    Eagerly I wished the morrow; -- vainly I had sought to borrow
            
                    From my books surcease of sorrow -- sorrow for the lost Lenore --
            
                    For the rare and radiant maiden whom the angels name Lenore --
            
                                            Nameless here for evermore.</p>

                    "Sir," said I, "or Madam, truly your forgiveness I implore;
            
                    But the fact is I was napping, and so gently you came rapping,
            
                    And so faintly you came tapping, tapping at my chamber door,

                    Doubting, dreaming dreams no mortal ever dared to dream before;
            
                    But the silence was unbroken, and the darkness gave no token,
            
                    And the only word there spoken was the whispered word, "Lenore!"
            
                    This I whispered, and an echo murmured back the word, "Lenore!" --

                    In there stepped a stately raven of the saintly days of yore;
            
                    Not the least obeisance made he; not an instant stopped or stayed he;
            
                    But, with mien of lord or lady, perched above my chamber door --
            
                    Perched upon a bust of Pallas just above my chamber door --

                On the pallid bust of Pallas just above my chamber door;
        
                And his eyes have all the seeming of a demon's that is dreaming,
        
                And the lamp-light o'er him streaming throws his shadow on the floor;
