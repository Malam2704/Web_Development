            <p>Well, do you want to see the skylines, but don't want to pay the outrageous costs & wait in the extremely
                long lines at the observatories? Well I got a few places for you. First we have the Long Island
                City Piers, a line of Skyscrapers in Queens, overlooking the East River, with e gorgeous view of Midtown,
                then if you hop on the Roosevelt Island Tram, you'll essentially be in a car in the sky trasnforming into the skyline itself.
                It's amazing.
            </p>

            <p>Another palce would be the Manhattan & Brooklyn Bridges. These are notorious toursit spots but they're so big,
                there's enough space for everyone, especially during the pandemic. You can get a Citibike for a few dollars and Bike across,
                or just stare at Both directions of the Brooklyn and Lower Manhattan skylines.
            </p>

            <p>Well, on the other ahdn more free things you can do is travel to Central Park, it is worth it.
                Although there are many people here at once Central Park has an abundance of amenities and a beautiful
                landscape, you can spend days and not finish it. 
            </p>
            <p>If you don't like the people as much, or want a more autehntic feel, I'd recommend
                Flushing Meadows Corona Park in Queens, or Prospect Park in Brooklyn, these parks
                are also huge, in facts Flushing Meadows is bigger than Central Park and was also the site
                of the world's fair, twice actually, 1939 and 1961. Not to mentions it's also home to Met's Stadium
                and the Arthur Ashe stadium, where the U.S. Open tennis tournament is held in BJK stadium.
