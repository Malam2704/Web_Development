                <h3>Am I being affected?</h3>
                <p>
                    In 2016, in an attempt to sow discord and influence the United States 
                    presidential election, Russian operatives played a major role in 
                    spreading disinformation on social media.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Much of the election disinformation EIP has tracked so far originates 
                    in conspiratorial corners of the right-wing media ecosystem. “What we’re 
                    seeing right now are essentially seeds being planted, dozens of seeds 
                    each day, of false stories,” says Emerson Brooking, a resident fellow 
                    at the Atlantic Council’s Digital Forensic Research Lab, which is part 
                    of EIP. “They’re all being planted such that they could be cited and 
                    reactivated … after the election” by groups attempting to delegitimize 
                    the result by claiming the vote was unfair or manipulated.

                <h3>What else are they doing?</h3>
                <p> Yochai Benkler, co-director of the Berkman Klein Center for Internet and 
                    Society at Harvardanalyzed more than 55,000 online news stories, 5 
                    million tweets, and 75,000 posts on public Facebook pages between 
                    March and August. They found that most spikes in media coverage and 
                    social media activity on the topic were driven by Trump himself—either 
                    through his own hyperactive Twitter account, press briefings, or 
                    appearances on the Fox TV network. “Donald Trump has perfected the 
                    art of harnessing mass media to disseminate and reinforce his 
                    disinformation campaign,” the researchers write in a preprint 
                    posted earlier this month.

        <h2 class="title_words">The effects on the election</h2>

            <section class="sub_section section_centered">
                <h3>Let's look at some stats!</h3>
                <p>To start off, a conservative media personality shared pictures that 100 votes in 
                    sonoma county CA, dumped 1000 mail in votes and the poll workers tried to cover it up
                    but The pictures revealed empty envelopes from the 2018 election, which had been 
                    collected for recycling, according to Sonoma county officers. The ballots for the 
                    general election this year have not yet been mailed. Even so, over 25,000 
                    Twitter users, including Donald Trump Jr., who has 5.7 million followers, 
                    posted a version of the fake ballot-dumping story within a single day.
                </p>
                <p>“This narrative that you’re not going to be able to trust the election 
                    results is really problematic,” says Kate Starbird, a crisis informatics 
                    researcher at the University of Washington’s Center for an Informed Public.
                </p>

                <h3>But what is being done to prevent all this?</h3>
                <p>EIP works with social media platforms to help them refine their policies 
                    and explain them so that they can respond to misinformation more quickly. 
                    Several businesses have taken recent steps to flag or delete information, 
                    or make it harder to share, if long overdue, steps experts say are welcome. 
                    (Some platforms often aim to drive users into healthier behaviors, such as 
                    the recent Twitter experiment with prompts that appear when someone 
                    attempts to share a connection to an article they have not opened, 
                    urging them to read it before sharing it first.)</p>
                <p>It won't be easy to quantify the effect of misinformation on the election. 
                    However, some hints may come from a research partnership with Facebook 
                    aimed at studying the effect of the platform on the election this year. 
                    The company provided access to data on the Facebook behavior of a large 
                    number of users who consented to be involved to 17 academic researchers. 
                    (Facebook plans to volunteer between 200,000 and 400,000 users.) 
                    Participants agree to respond to surveys and, in some cases, to 
                    leave Facebook for a period of time before the election to help 
                    researchers examine the impact on political attitudes and actions 
                    of the use of Facebook.</p>
