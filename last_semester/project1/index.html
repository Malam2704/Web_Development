            <h3><u>About Me</u></h3>
            <p>
               My name is Mohammed Alam, and I am a Computing Exploration Major
               at the Rochester Institute of Technology. I have had an interest 
               in computers since I was 8, but I never knew what aspect I specifically
               loved. My interests are pretty unique, to say the least, where I would
               love studying history and geography,  love learning about architecture
               and engineering, meanwhile tinkering my computers and learning about
               computer hardware. I love memorization too, I memorized all the world's 
               nation's capitals, the world's top 100 tallest buildings, and how to even
               build a computer without any guide, all at the age of 14.

            <h3><u>My Mission</u></h3>
            <p>
                This Website you're currently in displays my work, and my effort in 
                creating a website, displaying my web development skills. I want to 
                make a functional website that has the full functionality of any other
                website, that can also brign the attention of my professors and recruiters.
                I will also "show off" my HTML/CSS skills, showing you that my Linked In 
                endorsement wasn't a fluke.
