                    <dt>What is Fake News?</dt>
                    <dd>“Fake news” is information that has been deliberately fabricated 
                        and disseminated with the intention to deceive and mislead others 
                        into believing falsehoods or doubting verifiable facts;essentialy it's 
                        disinformation that is presented as, or is likely to be perceived 
                        as, news. 
                    </dd>

                    <dt>Why is it so bad?</dt>
                    <dd>Well first of all, problems arising from the absence of 
                        clear definitions is that national laws criminalizing “fake” or “false” 
                        news are susceptible to misuse and abuse through arbitrary 
                        interpretation and enforcement. Free speech NGOs like ARTICLE 19 report 
                        that such laws are often used by governments across the world to 
                        stifle independent and critical media, thereby creating a chilling 
                        effect on freedom of expression and public debate.  </dd>

                    <dt>So is it a new problem we just have to deal with?</dt>
                    <dd>"Fake news" is by no means a modern phenomenon, for all the current 
                        hysteria around the word. It's as ancient as the forest. Biased 
                        opinions and, on occasion, reports that lack factual grounding 
                        have often been peddled by the press, especially the partisan press. 
                        The issue was framed in terms of the danger posed by the systematic 
                        circulation of intentionally inaccurate or distorted reports to 
                        friendly relations between peoples and states. This boiled down 
                        basically to State-sponsored propaganda, disseminated by (puppet) 
                        news agencies. </dd>
