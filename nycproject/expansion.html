        <p>Well you might have heard about recent expansions and Gentrification, but take it form a local, it's a lot more extreme
            than you believe it is. Amazon was supposed to build a new HQ in LIC Queens, an area that has devleoped into a Manhattan-esque neighborhood
            with skyscrapers and a dense urban core, brigning along with it Downtown Brooklyn, in the image here. This is going to happen.
            New realestate prices are dropping, and that means people are going to buy, albeit it's going to be Heck for renters(keeping it PG).
            This lead to skyscrapers and new age buildigns replacing prewar and old brick buildings in Queens, Brooklyn, New Jersey, and even the Bronx, literally the start of
            Rap Music, Ghetto culture, and the American Struggle!
