            <h3>How did it all start?</h3>
            <p>New York, when you think of the actual name, it's named after a notbale English figure, the Duke of York, so you
                think the English would have founded the settlement, well it was actually the Dutch.
            </p>
            <p>In 1624 Dutch settlers, notable for their sea faring experience, founded the settlement of New Amsterdam, named after, well Amsterdam
                and thus began their flurry of expansion in the New World. They would soon travel beyond the Hudson River and develop cities such as 
                Albany in 1686.
            </p>
            <p>You might be wondering, who in god's name would travel nealry 4000 miles to another world, isolated by human contact? Well I'll tell you in God's name, ironically
                it was settlers migrating here form religious persecution following the feat of their British cousins the Puritans. These settlers would control the 
                Trade routes in the new world, exchange with the native Lenape people that lived here and make a buck or two for themselves.

            <h3>The Dutch influence Today</h3>
            <p>The Dutch were the forefathers of this city, well until the British took over in 1664, and the Americans took over in 1776. Although it ended nearly 350 years ago, many of the Dutch remnants still
                stand today oddly enough. We have neighborhoods such as Stuy-town(Figure 1).The influence exists outside of Manhattan too such as New Utrecht ave in South Brooklyn and Flushing avenue in North Queens.
                Outside of NYC and into neighborign New Jersey whcih the Dutch also colonized, various cities were named after them such as Hobokem and Hackensack.
            </p>
            <p>Aside form Geographical names we can see the Architecture forms that still stand today(Figure 2), the art deco, cathedrals and old european influence. Another one would be first mayor Peter Stuyvesant,
                who name is also in Stuyvesant Highschool arguably the best ranked Highschool in America One of the biggest influences
                would be the New York Knicks, could've been better but given their past seasons, not so much. The name Knicks come form the Dutch word KnickerBoker.
