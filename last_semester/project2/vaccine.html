                <h3>Introduction</h3>
                <p>
                So unless you've been living under a rock, you have heard about the debate
                between anti vaxxers, and who I like to call normal people. It's been all over the media
                and news sources have been keeping us upto date since it first aired, but you might
                be thinking, "Who made that up?". Well look no further it'll all be explained.
                </p>

                <h3>Graph explanation</h3>
                <p>
                The spread of fake news and misinformation on social media is blamed as a 
                primary cause of vaccine hesitancy. Several papers found that this 
                controversy had a significant effect on immunization choices. 
                Similarly,  Susan S Ellenberg, Louis M Bell, David M Rubin examined MMR uptake and 
                nonreceipt in the United States and found declines in 1999 and 2000 
                and then a return to previous levels of vaccination. 
                </p>

                <p>
                    First, it exploits a quasi‐experiment that occurred in March 2012 in Italy, 
                    when the Court of Rimini granted compensation to a family after recognizing 
                    that the MMR vaccine caused their child's autism. To our knowledge, this was 
                    the first time that an official body formally recognized a causal link 
                    between the MMR vaccine and autism. The Figure shows that the number of 
                    queries for «vaccines and autism» on the search engine Google increased 
                    drastically after March 2012 and remained quite stable afterwards. 
                </p>
    
                <h3>What about the graph?</h3>
                <p>
                    Italian court's decision, alongside the force of introduction to nontraditional 
                    media driven by local infrastructural contrasts in Internet broadband inclusion. 
                    Utilizing a Difference‐in‐Differences relapse on provincial board information, 
                    we show that the spread of this news brought about an abatement in youngster 
                    inoculation rates for a wide range of antibodies.

                <h3>What happened in Italy?</h3>
                <p>
                    On 29 January 2019, Washington State officially declared a state of emergency 
                    because of a measles plague. In Europe, between 1 February 2017, and 31 January 2018, 
                    the European Surveillance System announced 14,732 instances of measles.
                </p>

                <h3>Let's look at the stats</h3>
                <p>
                    In Italy, where the study was taken, there were 4,978 cases, the most! The main cause was
                    linked to the spread of fake news and misinformation. (Aquino et al., 2017; Dube, Vivion, 
                    & MacDonald, 2015; Jolley & Douglas, 2014; Smith & Marshall, 2010)
                </p>
                <h3>We can conclude</h3>
                <p>
                    Considering Today's climate it shoudl be well known the power vaccines had since
                    various epidemic in the past such as Polio and Flu. Just looking outside, you 
                    shouldn't really ignore them.
