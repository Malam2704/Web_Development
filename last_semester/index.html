            So as you can see from the title and header above, my name is Mohammed Alam, and I am a student
            in the Computing Exploration Major here at RIT. I was unsure about what I wanted to major in, but 
            I knew it had to be about computers.

                <span class="underlined">Starter:</span> My programming experience is a bit sporadic, and I don't know where it goes most of the time
                I have 3 years of learning experience for programming languages in highschool as follows
            </p>
        <dl>
            <dt class="def_term">Sophomore Year of H.S.</dt>
            <dd>
                <ol>
                    <li class="description">I tried my first ever programming class here, <span class="important">AP computer science principles</span>
                    and I didn't like the class, but I thought it was because I had a disinterest
                    in programming, but it was truly because I really didn't care for the class, and I 
                    would have friends that do everything for me, so I thought of it as pretty hard
                    and never gave effort because I didn't have to. I was supposed to learn the languages 
                    of SNAP/SCRATCH, and Processing. I did a meh final year project and did meh on the AP 
                    exam with a score of 3, barely enough to get by without programming. </li>
                </ol>

            <dt class="def_term">Junior Year of H.S.</dt>
            <dd>
                <ol>
                    <li class="description">Well I thought software wasn't for me, and I loved building computers so I thought
                    the mechanical engineering process was the way for me to go, so I chose a high school
                    major called mechatronics & robotics because I thought it was fascinating, it pretty 
                    much was, I would learn a language called <span class="important">Arduino</span>- which is a circuitry learning company
                    with different types of circuity pieces and circuits, we could code and tinker with. I would
                    make things such as calculators with the in the computer screen and use the digital push buttons 
                    as keys, and other things such as a button pressed sound and light shows displaying different 
                    light brightnesses and sound values. It was hard but pretty fun. </li>
    
                    <li class="description">I had to perform with another programming language called <span class="important">Robot-C</span> a version of C that 
                    is used by robots made by VEX, and we can programm them and map them to specific buttons, 
                    keys and controllers to do things like, display and LED, move this way, turn this way, and etc.
                    I was getting more accusotmed to it but the year ended so meh. </li>
    
                    <li class="description">Over the Summer I had a job and really didn't do much programming so I forgot a good deal 
                    about these languages, which I somewhat regretted. </li>
                </ol>

            <dd>
                <ol>
                    <li class="description">I've had a mroe defined level of programming knowledge this year. to keep it short, I learned
                    this thing called <span class="important">NI Labview</span> which was sort of a drag and drop program but the National Instruments
                    LABview circuitry, which was a pain, but still pretty cool. I learned various mechancial languages 
                    such as robocell which allowed me to control a robot's arm by programming the joints, to do 
                    things such as draw and write. I learned how to carve designs into resign and wooden blocks with 
                    <span class="important">CNC machining languages</span>, I learned to also use Autodesk inventor, not a prgramming language, but 
                    a professional designing tool which I was supposed ot get my PLTW certification for, along with 
                    the other languages. It was fun and I honed my level of Robot-C to an intermediate-advanced degree. </li>
                    
                    <li class="description">I regretted not taking APCSA, or Java, which a lot of my firends took, and wouldn've helped me, 
                    because I learned I actually loved programming and just wasn't exposed to a great initial enviornment
                    so it was a decision I regreted. </li>
    
                    <li class="description">I was supposed to use all these to display some final projects using industrial level 
                    machinery to make projects and robots. Like this one metal rocket piece I made with a plasma cutter,
                    and a huge robot that was supposed to play ping pong, albeit very slowly. We had to stop becuase of 
                    the pandemic, so at home I was taught <span class="important">Python and I was self taught HTML and CSS </span> that 
                    might get me by for a week or two. </li>
