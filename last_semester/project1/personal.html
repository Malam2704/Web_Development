        <h2>My Clubs</h2>
        <dl>
            <dt>Soccer Clubs</dt>
            <dd>We would go to the Brooklyn Bridge Park during the summer, and just have fun playing Soccer
                and honing our skills. It was nice and we'd stay up all day playing, also 
                the view is magic. <em>View seen below</em>

            </dd>

            <dt>Chess Club</dt>
            <dd>This was a huge club, where we had over 400 members back in 2016-2018, my frehsman
                and sophomore years in highschool. I used to go with my friends every Friday, and we'd 
                just relax playing chess, and talk. We would have tournaments,and other matches with many
                of the other kids too. I twas a fun way to get club credit in my opinion.
            </dd>
            <dt>SAT Club</dt>
            <dd>As stated in my resume, this was a favorite of mine, where I learned to tutor. I would use these 
                skills to get the jobs shown in my resume.
            </dd>
            <dt>South Asian Culture Club</dt>
            <dd>I sort of came here to ahgn out with ym friends, but we'd learn a few things about our cultural
                background, which I feel like I gnored for 16 years, and it also helped me bring upon another 
                point of view in my life.
            </dd>
            <dt>Muslim Student Association</dt>
            <dd>I used this as a way to ahng out with one of my friends, and I thought it
                would be a good addition to my college application, I felt an organization was lacking.
                Even though I don't consider myself religious, I learned a lot about my background
                just like the South Asian Culture CLub.

        <h2>Hobbies</h2>
        <dl>
            <dt>Learning</dt>
            <dd>I like leanring essentially, anything I deem cool, it varies from STEM to a liberal arts
                perspective. I take likings to things suck as city skylines, and skyscrapers: I don't know,
                but something so tall and so futuristic looking has a fascinating charm.
            </dd>
            <dt>Memorization</dt>
            <dd>As stated in the Home Page, I like to sort of challenge myself, and memorize things I find cool.
                I've found historical and geographical information pretty interesting, so I've taken akin to it.
                For that reason I know a lot about history and geography, also why I was able to memorizae all the 
                nations capitals.
            </dd>
            <dt>Computers</dt>
            <dd>I really like studying computers and researching their specifications. It's something that is essentially
                made out of natural elements, and can unite the whole world, giving us access to any bit of information,
                all in the palm of our hands. I built computers before, and I've spent a bit of time, maybe a bit too much,
                modifying the, chanigng grpahics cards, RAM, cooling fans etc. Anything I feel will give me a better experie
                nce on the web. Expecially since I'm spending 12+ hours a day infornt of my computers.
            </dd>
            <dt>Researching</dt>
            <dd>I also like applying what I'm learning. Lately the things <I></I> decided to learn
                about were information criticla to my future, such as the difference between a 
                Roth 401k and a Roth IRA <em>choose the Roth 401k, your interest won't get taxed.</em>
                I dealt into learning skills such as Marketing, probably why I spend time on the internet so much
                ,and I'm considering it as a backup career.
