        <p>Well I guess you've been peaked at my educational experiences, and I guess
           you'll just have to read on to find the rest.

            <h2>High School: <strong>The Brooklyn Technical High School</strong></h2>

            <p><u>Need to Know:</u> Well as you can see form the picture above, I went to the Brooklyn Technical
                High School or BTHS for short. It's one of the prestigious NYC Specialized 
                High School, but to me it was a lot more than that. It was organized in 1922
            under the Manhattan bridge's Dumbo neighborhood, but since 1933 has been at its
            location off of Fort Greene Park. Our school is noted as the <span class="important">largest Public
            Hignschool in America at approximately 6,500 students enrolled,</span> and we get a lot of funding
            more than we should. 
            </p>
            <p>
            <u>Date of Attendance:</u> Sept. 2016 - June 2020
            </p>
            <p>
            <u>School Basics:</u> Well the school is a STEM education based school, where for 9 and 10th 
            grades all students were on a general education/technical track taking regular 
            classes along with some tech related classes such as PLTW Design Drafting & Production
            and AP Computer Science Principles. 
            </p>
            <p>
            <u>School Majors:</u> We did have something special compared to other schools, school majors for 11th & 12th
            grades. These majors allow you to take classes based on what academic major track you
            choose, if you choose Social Science you'd have to take a sociology class, AP human
            geography and the works. We have 18 majors, and I was in a CTE major, <em>Career and 
            Technical education</em> , where we would build and learn technical skills for the future.
            These were heavy Tech related majors such as Software ,Aerospace,Civil, Electrical 
            Engineering, and Industrial Design,Architecture, and mine: Mechatronics and Robotics.
            I was a mix of computing and engineering, where would would learn programming, in 
            the mechanical discipline making robots, and controlling automated machines with code.
            </p> 
            <p>
                <u>Bonuses:</u> I was also in many clubs and organizations, because the school has over 160
                to off its students. I joined various clubs such as, the SAT club, the Soccer club,the South Asian culture club, 
                the Muslim students Association, and my all time favorite, the CHESS club, these clubs all had
                phenomenal membership, but the chess club came in at it's 2018 peak of 452 students, wow! I 'd visit some other clubs
                but would never consider myself a member.

            <h2>College: The Rochester Institute of Technology</h2>
            
            <p>
                <u>School Basics:</u> The Rochester Institute of Technology is a private university
                in the greater Rochester are of NY, not Minnesota! It has a current undergraduate 
                enrollment of approximated 13,500 students, and it's renown for it's Golisano College
                of Computing, <span class="important">with it's amazing stats including the first Software Engineering program
                in the U.S., the 95% job placement rate, 25th best college in securing jobs, and etc.</span> 
            </p>
            <p>
                <u>Where I am:</u> So I am currently a freshman at the Computing Exploration Major at RIT
                , an undecided major for student looking to get into the computing field, but can't decide
                between majors such as Computing Information Technology, Computer Science, Computing Security, Web and Mobile Computing, Software Engineering,
                Human Centered Computing, and New Media and Interactive Development. 
            </p>
            <p>
                <u>Where I see myself:</u> I am currently interested in the Web and Mobile Computing Major 
                here at RIT. I'm just fascinated about the wide varieties of tasks done by the many types of
                developers, and I would love to see myself as a Full Stack developer in the future.
