                <h3>Below are quotes form MIT researchers</h3>
                <p> It seems to be pretty clear [from our study] that false information 
                    outperforms true information,” said Soroush Vosoughi, a data 
                    scientist at MIT who has studied fake news since 2013 and who 
                    led this study. “And that is not just because of bots. It might 
                    have something to do with human nature.”  </p>
                
                <h3>Specifically how much has it affected our information intake?</h3>
                <p> Though the study is written in the clinical language of statistics, 
                    it offers a methodical indictment of the accuracy of information 
                    that spreads on these platforms. A false story is much more likely 
                    to go viral than a real story, the authors find. A false story 
                    reaches 1,500 people six times quicker, on average, than a true 
                    story does. And while false stories outperform the truth on every 
                    subject—including business, terrorism and war, science and 
                    technology, and entertainment—fake news about politics regularly 
                    does best. </p>

                <h3>So we should jsut get rid of bots, and have people moderating the traffic?</h3>
                <p> And blame for this problem cannot be laid with our robotic brethren. 
                    From 2006 to 2016, Twitter bots amplified true stories as much as 
                    they amplified false ones, the study found. Fake news prospers, 
                    the authors write, “because humans, not robots, are more likely 
                    to spread it.” </p>

                <h3>What happened with Facebook?</h3>

                <p> Craig Silverman of Buzzfeed was one of the first people to 
                    understand these problems and has been tracking the creation 
                    of fake news on the Internet for quite a long time. According 
                    to BuzzFeed, counterfeit news spiked on Facebook, exceeding 
                    genuine news in August, allegedly after human security tests 
                    were excused for PC calculations. When asked if he suspected 
                    the dissemination of fake news online influenced the political 
                    decision, Silverman said it was hard to know without a doubt. </p>  
                    
                <p>Here's a statement from Silverman, "“But there is no doubt that 
                    when, for instance, we took a gander at the main 20 phony 
                    reports about the political race and contrasted them with 
                    the best 20 political decision stories from 19 significant 
                    news sources, the phony news ones got greater commitment on 
                    Facebook"</p>

                <h3>What happened with Google?</h3>

                <p>Silverman also noted that A recent Pew Research study found that 
                    62 percent of American adults get their news from social media, 
                    with Facebook leading the way by far. Nearly two-thirds of its 
                    users get news from the platform. </p>

                <p>A recent Pew Research study found that, with Facebook leading 
                    the way by far, 62 percent of American adults get their news 
                    from social media. About two thirds of its users receive news 
                    from the site.</p>

                <p>Here's another statement, "Google is making money off fake news 
                    because Google has a huge ad network called AdSense that within 
                    a few minutes you can put AdSense ads on basically any website"</p>
